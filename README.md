# Hackernews_Pipeline

The data we will use comes from a Hacker News (HN) API that returns JSON data of the top stories.
It is similar to Reddit, but the community only revolves around on computer science and entrepreneurship posts.

Using this dataset, we will run a sequence of basic natural language processing tasks using our Pipeline class. The goal will be to find the top keywords of Hacker News posts in 2014. Because Hacker News is the most popular technology social media site, this will give us an understanding of the most talked about tech topics in 2014!
